# De-Bruijn-Graph-Genome-Visualization
Builds de Bruijn graph from genome reads and visualizes in browser using vis.js. It's meant to be used for relatively small data sets and helps when learning genome sequencing algorithms.

To use it, simply open index.html, select kmer size, width and height of network canvas, and provide reads of genome; then click on 'Display'. Kmers are displayed as edges between nodes.
